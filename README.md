# INF8215 - Artificial Intelligence: Methods and algorithms

This repository hosts our code written as part of our Artificial Intelligence class. 


It contains three module, one for each of the practical work assignments we had.

1. Research methods: This first assignment, completed in the form of a Python Notebook, aimed to use different search methods to explore a search tree. With this in mind, we implemented:
	..1. Breadth-first search (BFS)
	..2. A* algorithm (Djikstra algorithm)
	..3. Edmond's algorithm
	..4. Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)
	..5. An additional bonus question: "Explain in which situation each of the developed algorithms is more appropriate". 
	
2. Logic Prpgramming: This lab was about constraint and logic programming. We got to explore:
	..1. MiniZinc for simple constraint programming
	..2. MiniZinc for more complex constraint programming
	..3. Prolog for simple logic programming
	..4. Prolog for more complex logic programming (building a simple version of Akinator, a know-it-all chatbot who guesses who or what you're thinking about)
	
3. Machine Learning: This lab was a major assignment about typical machine learning problems. Although libraries like SK-Learn offer pre-implemented algorithms, we had to code the algorithms ourselves to get a sense of how they work. We implemented:
	..1. A one-hot encoder
	..2. Softmax function and a general softmax classifier
	..3. Log loss (cross entropy) cost function
	..4. Gradient descent
	..5. L2 regularization
	..6. Data pre-processing using Scikit-Learn and Pandas and the pipeline architecture
	..7. We also compared multiple models in order to see their respective performance on the dataset (Softmax classifier vs Decision tree vs GaussianNB)
